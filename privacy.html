Privacy Policy for Job Fill Chrome Extension

Last updated: Jan 11, 2026

Job Fill respects your privacy. This extension is designed to help users autofill job application forms using information they voluntarily provide.

Data Collection
Job Fill does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data with third parties.

Data Storage
All user-provided information (such as name, contact details, education, and work history) is stored locally in the user’s browser using Chrome’s storage APIs. This data never leaves the user’s device.

Data Usage
Stored information is used only to autofill job application forms on the currently active webpage when the user explicitly triggers the extension.

Permissions
The extension uses browser permissions strictly to support its core functionality, such as accessing form fields on the active page and storing user data locally. No background access or tracking is performed.

Third-Party Services
Job Fill does not use analytics services, advertising networks, or third-party trackers.

User Control
Users can edit or delete their stored data at any time by removing the extension or clearing extension storage.

Changes
This privacy policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected on this page.
